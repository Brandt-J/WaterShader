Relatively simple but still beautiful water shader.
Comes with:
 - Caustics
 - Foam
 - Adjustable transparency
 - Dynamic waves
 - global UVs, guaranteeing seamless water material


Main parameters to play with:
 - water_color_ratio: Intensity of water color tinting
 - depth_distance: Level of transparency
 - caustics_power & caustics_distance: Strength of caustics
 - foam_distance: How far does the foam reach out
